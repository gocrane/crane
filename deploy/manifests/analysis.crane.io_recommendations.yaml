                  are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage when
                  embedded in APIs.  1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields which
                  are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath
                  are both very rarely valid in actual usage.  2. Invalid usage help.  It
                  is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.  In most
                  embedded usages, there are particular     restrictions like, "must
                  refer only to types A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must
                  be restricted".     Those cannot be well described when embedded.  3.
                  Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages are different, the
                  validation rules are different by usage, which makes it hard for
                  users to predict what will happen.  4. The fields are both imprecise
                  and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping to a URL. This
                  can produce ambiguity     during interpretation and require a REST
                  mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is on the group,resource
                  tuple     and the version of the actual struct is irrelevant.  5.
                  We cannot easily change it.  Because this type is embedded in many
                  locations, updates to this type     will affect numerous schemas.  Don''t
                  make new APIs embed an underspecified API type they do not control.
                  Instead of using this type, create a locally provided and used type
                  that is well-focused on your reference. For example, ServiceReferences
                  for admission registration: https://github.com/kubernetes/api/blob/release-1.17/admissionregistration/v1/types.go#L533

                      For example, if the object reference is to a container within
                      a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}"
