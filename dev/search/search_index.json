Associated configuration: ehpa.deployment-min-replicas | ehpa.statefulset-min-replicas | ehpa.workload-min-replicas Workload with a certain percentage of not running pods: if the workload of Pod mostly can't run normally, may not be suitable for flexibility. Associated configuration: ehpa.pod-min-ready-seconds | ehpa.pod-available-ratio Workload with low CPU usage: The low CPU usage workload means that there is no load pressure. In this case, we can't estimate it. Associated configuration: ehpa.min-cpu-usage-threshold Workload with low fluctuation of CPU usage: dividing of the maximum and minimum usage is defined as the fluctuation rate. If the fluctuation rate is too low, the workload will not benefit much from hpa. Associated configuration: ehpa.fluctuation-threshold Advising \u00b6 In the advising phase, one EffectiveHPA Spec is recommended using the following Algorithm model. The recommended logic for each field is as follows: Recommend TargetUtilization Principle: Use Pod P99 resource utilization to recommend hpa. Because if the application can accept this utilization over P99 time, it can be inferred as a target for elasticity. Get the Pod P99 usage of the past seven days by Percentile algorithm: pod_cpu_usage_p99 Corresponding utilization: target_pod_CPU_utilization = pod_cpu_usage_p99 / pod_cpu_request To prevent over-utilization or under-utilization, target_pod_cpu_utilization needs to be less than ehpa.min-cpu-target-utilization and greater than ehpa. max-cpu-target-utilization Recommend minReplicas Principle: MinReplicas are recommended for the lowest hourly workload utilization for the past seven days. Calculate the lowest median workload cpu usage of the past seven days: workload_cpu_usage_medium_min Corresponding replicas: minReplicas = workload_cpu_usage_medium_min / pod_cpu_request / ehpa.max-cpu-target-utilization To prevent the minReplicas being too small, the minReplicas must be greater than or equal to ehpa.default-min-replicas Recommend maxReplicas Principle: Use workload's past and future seven days load to recommend maximum replicas.

Besides that, EffectiveHorizontalPodAutoscaler also defines several scale strategies to support different scaling scenarios.

MinReplicas is the lower limit replicas to the scale target which the autoscaler can scale down to. MaxReplicas is the upper limit replicas to the scale target which the autoscaler can scale up to. ScaleStrategy indicates the strategy to scaling target, value can be \"Auto\" and \"Preview\". Metrics contains the specifications for which to use to calculate the desired replica count. Prediction defines configurations for predict resources.If unspecified, defaults don't enable prediction. PredictionWindowSeconds is the time window to predict metrics in the future. Prediction-driven autoscaling \u00b6 Most of online applications follow regular pattern. We can predict future trend of hours or days. DSP is a time series prediction algorithm that applicable for application metrics prediction. The following shows a sample EffectiveHorizontalPodAutoscaler yaml with prediction enabled. apiVersion : autoscaling.crane.io/v1alpha1 kind : EffectiveHorizontalPodAutoscaler spec : prediction : predictionWindowSeconds : 3600 predictionAlgorithm : algorithmType : dsp dsp : sampleInterval : \"60s\" historyLength : \"3d\" Metric conversion \u00b6 When user defines spec.metrics in EffectiveHorizontalPodAutoscaler and prediction configuration is enabled, EffectiveHPAController will convert it to a new metric and configure the background HorizontalPodAutoscaler. This is a source EffectiveHorizontalPodAutoscaler yaml for metric definition. apiVersion : autoscaling.crane.io/v1alpha1 kind : EffectiveHorizontalPodAutoscaler spec : metrics : - type : Resource resource : name : cpu target : type : Utilization averageUtilization : 50 It's converted to underlying HorizontalPodAutoscaler metrics yaml. apiVersion : autoscaling/v2beta1 kind : HorizontalPodAutoscaler spec : metrics : - pods : metric : name : crane_pod_cpu_usage selector : matchLabels : autoscaling.crane.io/effective-hpa-uid : f9b92249-eab9-4671-afe0-17925e5987b8 target : type : AverageValue averageValue : 100m type : Pods - resource : name : cpu target : type : Utilization averageUtilization : 50 type : Resource In this sample, the resource metric defined by user is converted into two metrics: prediction metric and origin metric. prediction metric is custom metrics that provided by component MetricAdapter. Since custom metric doesn't support targetAverageUtilization , it's converted to targetAverageValue based on target pod cpu request. origin metric is equivalent to user defined metrics in EffectiveHorizontalPodAutoscaler, to fall back to baseline user defined in case of some unexpected situation e.g. business traffic sudden growth. HorizontalPodAutoscaler will calculate on each metric, and propose new replicas based on that. The largest one will be picked as the new scale. Horizontal scaling process \u00b6 There are six steps of prediction and scaling process: EffectiveHPAController create HorizontalPodAutoscaler and TimeSeriesPrediction instance PredictionCore get historic metric from prometheus and persist into TimeSeriesPrediction HPAController read metrics from KubeApiServer KubeApiServer forward requests to MetricAdapter and MetricServer HPAController calculate all metric results and propose a new scale replicas for target HPAController scale target with Scale Api Below is the process flow. Use case \u00b6 Let's take one use case that using EffectiveHorizontalPodAutoscaler in production cluster. We did a profiling on the load history of one application in production and replayed it in staging environment. With the same application, we leverage both EffectiveHorizontalPodAutoscaler and HorizontalPodAutoscaler to manage the scale and compare the result. From the red line in below chart, we can see its actual total cpu usage is high at ~8am, ~12pm, ~8pm and low in midnight. The green line shows the prediction cpu usage trend. Below is the comparison result between EffectiveHorizontalPodAutoscaler and HorizontalPodAutoscaler. The red line is the replica number generated by HorizontalPodAutoscaler and the green line is the result from EffectiveHorizontalPodAutoscaler. We can see significant improvement with EffectiveHorizontalPodAutoscaler: Scale up in advance before peek flow Scale down gracefully after peek flow Fewer replicas changes than HorizontalPodAutoscaler ScaleStrategy \u00b6 EffectiveHorizontalPodAutoscaler provides two strategies for scaling: Auto and Preview . User can change the strategy at runtime, and it will take effect on the fly. Auto \u00b6 Auto strategy achieves automatic scaling based on metrics. It is the default strategy. With this strategy, EffectiveHorizontalPodAutoscaler will create and control a HorizontalPodAutoscaler instance in backend. We don't recommend explicit configuration on the underlying HorizontalPodAutoscaler because it will be overridden by EffectiveHPAController. If user delete EffectiveHorizontalPodAutoscaler, HorizontalPodAutoscaler will be cleaned up too. Preview \u00b6 Preview strategy means EffectiveHorizontalPodAutoscaler won't change target's replicas automatically, so you can preview the calculated replicas and control target's replicas by themselves. User can switch from default strategy to this one by applying spec.scaleStrategy to Preview . It will take effect immediately, During the switch, EffectiveHPAController will disable HorizontalPodAutoscaler if exists and scale the target to the value spec.specificReplicas , if user not set spec.specificReplicas , when ScaleStrategy is change to Preview, it will just stop scaling. A sample preview configuration looks like following: apiVersion : autoscaling.crane.io/v1alpha1 kind : EffectiveHorizontalPodAutoscaler spec : scaleStrategy : Preview # ScaleStrategy indicate the strategy to scaling target, value can be \"Auto\" and \"Preview\". specificReplicas : 5 # SpecificReplicas specify the target replicas. status : expectReplicas : 4 # expectReplicas is the calculated replicas that based on prediction metrics or spec.specificReplicas. currentReplicas : 4 # currentReplicas is actual replicas from target HorizontalPodAutoscaler compatible \u00b6 EffectiveHorizontalPodAutoscaler is designed to be compatible with k8s native HorizontalPodAutoscaler, because we don't reinvent the autoscaling part but take advantage of the extension from HorizontalPodAutoscaler and build a high level autoscaling CRD. EffectiveHorizontalPodAutoscaler support all abilities from HorizontalPodAutoscaler like metricSpec and behavior. EffectiveHorizontalPodAutoscaler will continue support incoming new feature from HorizontalPodAutoscaler.

a load-aware scheduler plugin \u00b6 Introduction \u00b6 Native scheduler of kubernetes can only schedule pods by resource request, which can easily cause a series of load uneven problems: for some nodes, the actual load is not much different from the resource request, which will lead to a very high probability of stability problems. for others, the actual load is much smaller than the resource request, which will lead to a huge waste of resources. To solve these problems, Dynamic scheduler builds a simple but efficient model based on actual node utilization data\uff0cand filters out those nodes with high load to balance the cluster. Design Details \u00b6 Architecture \u00b6 As shown above, Dynamic scheduler relies on Prometheus and Node-exporter to collect and aggregate metrics data, and it consists of two components: Note Node-annotator is currently a module of Crane-scheduler-controller . Node-annotator periodically pulls data from Prometheus and marks them with timestamp on the node in the form of annotations. Dynamic plugin reads the load data directly from the node's annotation, filters and scores candidates based on a simple algorithm. Scheduler Policy \u00b6 Dynamic provides a default scheduler policy and supports user-defined policies. The default policy reies on following metrics: cpu_usage_avg_5m cpu_usage_max_avg_1h cpu_usage_max_avg_1d mem_usage_avg_5m mem_usage_max_avg_1h mem_usage_max_avg_1d At the scheduling Filter stage, the node will be filtered if the actual usage rate of this node is greater than the threshold of any of the above metrics. And at the Score stage, the final score is the weighted sum of these metrics' values. Hot Value \u00b6 In the production cluster, scheduling hotspots may occur frequently because the load of the nodes can not increase immediately after the pod is created. Therefore, we define an extra metrics named Hot Value , which represents the scheduling frequency of the node in recent times.

collection of scheduler plugins based on scheduler framework , including: Dynamic scheuler: a load-aware scheduler plugin Get Started \u00b6 1. Install Prometheus \u00b6 Make sure your kubernetes cluster has Prometheus installed. If not, please refer to Install Prometheus . 2. Configure Prometheus Rules \u00b6 1) Configure the rules of Prometheus to get expected aggregated data: apiVersion : monitoring.coreos.com/v1 kind : PrometheusRule metadata : name : example-record spec : groups : - name : cpu_mem_usage_active interval : 30s rules : - record : cpu_usage_active expr : 100 - (avg by (instance) (irate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode=\"idle\"}[30s])) * 100) - record : mem_usage_active expr : 100*(1-node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes/node_memory_MemTotal_bytes) - name : cpu-usage-5m interval : 5m rules : - record : cpu_usage_max_avg_1h expr : max_over_time(cpu_usage_avg_5m[1h]) - record : cpu_usage_max_avg_1d expr : max_over_time(cpu_usage_avg_5m[1d]) - name : cpu-usage-1m interval : 1m rules : - record : cpu_usage_avg_5m expr : avg_over_time(cpu_usage_active[5m]) - name : mem-usage-5m interval : 5m rules : - record : mem_usage_max_avg_1h expr : max_over_time(mem_usage_avg_5m[1h]) - record : mem_usage_max_avg_1d expr : max_over_time(mem_usage_avg_5m[1d]) - name : mem-usage-1m interval : 1m rules : - record : mem_usage_avg_5m expr : avg_over_time(mem_usage_active[5m]) \u26a0\ufe0fTroubleshooting: The sampling interval of Prometheus must be less than 30 seconds, otherwise the above rules(such as cpu_usage_active) may not take effect. 2) Update the configuration of Prometheus service discovery to ensure that node_exporters/telegraf are using node name as instance name: - job_name : kubernetes-node-exporter tls_config : ca_file : /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt insecure_skip_verify : true bearer_token_file : /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token scheme : https kubernetes_sd_configs : ... # Host name - source_labels : [ __meta_kubernetes_node_name ] target_label : instance ... Note: This step can be skipped if the node name itself is the host IP. 3. Install Crane-scheduler \u00b6 There are two options: 1) Install Crane-scheduler as a second scheduler: helm repo add crane https://gocrane.github.io/helm-charts helm install scheduler -n crane-system --create-namespace --set global.prometheusAddr = \"REPLACE_ME_WITH_PROMETHEUS_ADDR\" crane/scheduler 2) Replace native Kube-scheduler with Crane-scheduler: 1) Backup /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-scheduler.yaml cp /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-scheduler.yaml /etc/kubernetes/ 2) Modify configfile of kube-scheduler( scheduler-config.yaml ) to enable Dynamic scheduler plugin and configure plugin args: apiVersion : kubescheduler.config.k8s.io/v1beta2 kind : KubeSchedulerConfiguration ... profiles : - schedulerName : default-scheduler plugins : filter : enabled : - name : Dynamic score : enabled : - name : Dynamic weight : 3 pluginConfig : - name : Dynamic args : policyConfigPath : /etc/kubernetes/policy.yaml ... 3) Create /etc/kubernetes/policy.yaml , using as scheduler policy of Dynamic plugin: apiVersion : scheduler.policy.crane.io/v1alpha1 kind : DynamicSchedulerPolicy spec : syncPolicy : ##cpu usage - name : cpu_usage_avg_5m period : 3m - name : cpu_usage_max_avg_1h period : 15m - name : cpu_usage_max_avg_1d period : 3h ##memory usage - name : mem_usage_avg_5m period : 3m - name : mem_usage_max_avg_1h period : 15m - name : mem_usage_max_avg_1d period : 3h predicate : ##cpu usage - name : cpu_usage_avg_5m maxLimitPecent : 0.65 - name : cpu_usage_max_avg_1h maxLimitPecent : 0.75 ##memory usage - name : mem_usage_avg_5m maxLimitPecent : 0.65 - name : mem_usage_max_avg_1h maxLimitPecent : 0.75 priority : ##cpu usage - name : cpu_usage_avg_5m weight : 0.2 - name : cpu_usage_max_avg_1h weight : 0.3 - name : cpu_usage_max_avg_1d weight : 0.5 ##memory usage - name : mem_usage_avg_5m weight : 0.2 - name : mem_usage_max_avg_1h weight : 0.3 - name : mem_usage_max_avg_1d weight : 0.5 hotValue : - timeRange : 5m count : 5 - timeRange : 1m count : 2 4) Modify kube-scheduler.yaml and replace kube-scheduler image with Crane-scheduler\uff1a ... image : docker.io/gocrane/crane-scheduler:0.0.23 ... 1) Install crane-scheduler-controller : kubectl apply ./deploy/controller/rbac.yaml && kubectl apply -f ./deploy/controller/deployment.yaml 4.

RawQuery is a query by DSL, such as prometheus query language. now support prometheus. ExpressionQuery is a query by Expression selector. Now we only support prometheus as data source. We define the MetricType to orthogonal with the datasource. but now maybe some datasources do not support the metricType. Algorithm \u00b6 Algorithm define the algorithm type and params to do predict for the metric. Now there are two kinds of algorithms: dsp is an algorithm to forcasting a time series, it is based on FFT(Fast Fourier Transform), it is good at predicting some time series with seasonality and periods. percentile is an algorithm to estimate a time series, and find a recommended value to represent the past time series, it is based on exponentially-decaying weights historgram statistics. it is used to estimate a time series, it is not good at to predict a time sequences, although the percentile can output a time series predicted data, but it is all the same value. so if you want to predict a time sequences, dsp is a better choice. dsp params \u00b6 percentile params \u00b6","title":"Time Series Prediction"},{"location":"zh/tutorials/using-time-series-prediction/#timeseriesprediction","text":"Knowing the future makes things easier for us.
